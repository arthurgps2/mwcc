# Murder with Custom Characters

Have you ever played Garry's Mod Murder and thought: "Man, I wish I could play as more characters other than the default ones with random names and colors"? Well now you can! 

Murder with Custom Characters is a modification of the original gamemode by MechanicalMind that allows you to set a list of characters for players to play as - including workshop. It's very easy to set up using the command `mwcc_char_panel` and you can save/load your configs from files, hooray!

You still need **Counter-Strike: Source** installed. If you're getting missing textures, models etc, you're probably missing CS:S.

*I'd like to thank the original creator for making such a timeless gamemode. You brought lots of fun and memorable moments throughout the years, to many players and YouTube viewers who couldn't afford the game at the time - me included, I laugh at those videos to this day :)*

<sub>Feel free to push changes to this repository. This is the first time I'm making a GMod gamemode and it's definitely rough around the edges, so any help would be appreciated!<sub>

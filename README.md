# Murder with Custom Characters

Have you ever played Garry's Mod Murder and thought "I wish I could play as more characters other than the default ones with random names and colors"? Well now you can (or will be able to, I'm still working on this)! 

Murder with Custom Characters, as the name says, is a modification of the original gamemode by MechanicalMind that allows you to select characters from the workshop to be playable. It's very easy to set up and you can save/load your configs from files, hooray!

I haven't done any code writing as of the time I'm writing this, so I'll get back to this README when I actually have something done. Thanks for waiting! 

Oh, and feel free to push any changes here. Though I've worked with network games using Lua in the past, this is the first time ever that I'm making a GMod gamemode, so I'd appreciate any help from someone with a better grasp on this topic!
